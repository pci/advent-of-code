# Advent of code 2019

Going to try Rust for this one. This is my first foray into Rust so expect a lot of unidiomatic code that if you know rust may make you shout in dispair. Sorry about that.

## Running the code

Most days can be run by cd-ing into their folder and running

```bash
cargo run <input_file>
```
